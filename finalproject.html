            <h2> Breadboard Prototype </h2>
            <p>
                2-22-19
            </p>
            <p>
                I built an operational protoype of the Hydration Helper using a breadboard and ardunio. The tilt sensor is strapped to a water bottle and connected to the rest of the circuit via alligator clips. 
            </p>
            <p>
                When a user has waited more than the maximum time between sips, the LED turns on. When a user takes a sip, the LED blinks slowly once and then turns off to indicate that it sensed the sip and the timer has been restarted. To demonstrate the working system, the maximum time between sips is set to 5 second in the gif below, rather than the intended 30 mins for the final system.

                I decided to switch to a pull-down resistor connected to the tilt sensor. This way, when the sensor is not activated, that part of the circuit will not draw any current. The sensor is expected to spend most of its time not activated, so this should save battery.

            <h2> Tilt Sensor Test </h2>
            <p>

            <p>
                I started by building out a circuit with the tilt sensor to make sure I knew how to get that working and read from it. The gif below shows the tilt sensor being used to turn on the onboard led (pin 13). The basic circuit design was taken from the <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/InputPullupSerial">Arduino InputPullupSerial</a> example. 
            </p>
            <img src="final_project_tilt_sensor.gif" width=400/>
            <p>
                By building out the tilt sensor example, I realized that I had a floating input pin in my original proposed schematic (from 1-31-19). In the gif above, I'm using the built in pullup resistor on the arduino pin.             
            </p>
