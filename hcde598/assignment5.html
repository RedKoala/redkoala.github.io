            <p>
                I made a teensy tinesy copper cube with finger Joints!

            <h2> Attempt 1</h2>
            <h3> Dogbones </h3>
            <p> 
                With sharp inner corners, and a round end mill, I needed to add dogbones to complete my project. I found <a href="https://medium.com/@arstein/prepping-your-model-for-milling-9e6271acfa3c">this article</a> really helpful for getting the geometry right.
            </p>
            <p> 
                The only issue was that the article says to make your circle the exact same diameter as your bit. Bantam Tools shows an error and wants you to use a bigger end mill if you do this, so I had to go back to the drawing board. I found that 1.5 * diameter of the end mill worked best.

            <h2>Attempt 2</h2>
            <h3> Zero Tolerance </h3>
            <p>
                I started by making the slots and tabs all the same size. Each side measures 25mm, with each tab and slot 5mm wide. Their depth is that of the copper plate.

            <p> 
                This proved to be a mistake. The pieces didn't actually fit together. But that's what iteration is for!

            <h3> Smooth Milling </h3>
            <img src="a5_milling.gif" width="400"/>
            <p> 
                I didn't have any issues with operating the mill this go around. The pieces came out as expected. 
            </p>

            <h3> <strike>Some</strike> All Assembly Required</h3>
            <p> 
                Unfortunately, though the pieces came out as expected, there was design flaw. I only designed 2 unique sides to my cube, but they didn't all fit together in 3D. When I had two sides, I put together my assembly in Fusion before milling, but only tested with 2 sides ::smh::. Next time, I will assemble the WHOLE thing to make sure it all looks right. 
            </p>

            <h2>Attempt 3</h2>

            <h3> 3 Sides to a Cube </h3>
            <p>
                I added a 3rd type of side, which was a combination of the other two shapes, so that it can fit in with the other two.
            </p>
            <img src="a5_3_sides_fusion.png" width="600"/>
            <p>
                Since I left one side the same, I only needed to print two of each of the other two sides.
            </p>
            <img src="a5_4_sides.png" width="600"/>

            <h3> Ok, Some Tolerance</h3>
            <p>
                I measured roughly a .3mm tolerance needed for the slots, but went with .4 to be sure. I left one side the same but changed the slots on the other to 5.4mm and it's tabs to 4.6mm.
            </p>

            <p> And this time it fit! </p>

            <h2>Final Product</h2>
            <p> The three sides worked together well.</p>

            <p> And now I have a cute little shiny trinket box thing!</p>
