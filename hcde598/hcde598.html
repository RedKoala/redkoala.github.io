            My name is Colleen! I'm UW's first Maker in Residence. My role is to understand how makerspaces are being used and how we can improve the student experience. My background is in computer science and user experience design. In this class I'm hoping to learn how to rapidly prototype physical products using 3D modeling and CNC machines. I'm also hoping to learn how the makerspaces on campus can best support classes in fabrication, so please free to reach out to me with feedback :)

            P. S. My previous job was working as a UX Designer and Researcher on human space flight software at NASA. So also reach out to me if you want to talk about human centered design for astronauts!
